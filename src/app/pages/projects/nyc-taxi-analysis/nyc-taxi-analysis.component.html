    <h2>200000+ Trips per zone</h2>
    <p>In the pursuit of optimizing taxi services within Manhattan, an examination of zones with 200,000 taxi trips reveals that all but two outliers, namely the zones housing JFK and LaGuardia airports, align with the predetermined center of Manhattan. This insight underscores the significance of these airport-centric anomalies in the broader transportation network analysis.</p>
